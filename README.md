# ARC Watch

Public dashboard for ARC protocol metrics and a curated project directory.

## Run locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Project directory data is read from Neon. Configure `DATABASE_URL`, `ADMIN_PASSWORD`, and `ADMIN_SESSION_SECRET` as server-only Vercel environment variables. Do not add their values to source files or client-side `NEXT_PUBLIC_` variables. For local development, run the app or migration with Vercel's environment runner so secrets do not need to be copied into the repository.

After linking the repository to the Vercel project and configuring its environment variables, initialize the database with:

```bash
vercel env run -- npm run db:migrate
```

The migration creates the project directory and project updates tables and imports the existing Vort and KAIRO entries. It can be re-run safely.

## Project management

Open `/admin` and sign in with the administrator password configured for the deployment. Project records are stored in `ecosystem_projects`; project announcements and source links are stored in `ecosystem_project_updates`. The public directory only returns published records.

The `arc-project-intake` Codex skill gathers and checks project details from official sources, then prepares project metadata and recent updates for the authenticated admin workflow.

## Deploy

Vercel deploys the connected GitHub branch using the default Next.js build settings. Environment-variable changes apply to new deployments.
